# Chernogorsk-Football-Military-Camp
This adds a medium sized Military Camp to one of the Football Fields in northern Chernogorsk.

In the top right, press code and download the ZIP file. 
Place "Cherno Milcamp" into your custom folder. 
Add "custom/Cherno Milcamp" too the objectSpawnersArr line in cfggameplay.json file.
Add the MapsGroupprottos line into your servers own file so your economy items spawn into the tents.

In my own opinion this is a good location for PVP based servers, but also for boosted servers if you want more military locations/loot around the coast.
